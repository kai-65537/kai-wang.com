# Kai's blog

Detached from [tufte-jekyll]https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll - thanks to clayh53 for making such a wonderful theme!  

My name is Kai, also known as jan Kajo, Caeruleum, and Gayjeou (钙韭) in other contexts or previously. I write about math, coding, languages, and whatever I find interesting! Sometime I will feel the need to document something, and I will come here to write about it. Have fun reading and exploring!
