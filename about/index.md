My name is **Kai**, also known as **jan Kajo**, **Caeruleum**, and **Gayjeou (钙韭)** in other contexts or previously. I write about math, coding, languages, and whatever I find interesting! Sometime I will feel the need to document something, and I will come here to write about it. Have fun reading and exploring!

This blog is detached from the jekyll theme [tufte-jekyll](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) - thanks to clayh53 for making such a wonderful theme!
