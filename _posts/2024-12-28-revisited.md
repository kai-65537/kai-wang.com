## Introduction

2024 was one of *those* years for me. So many had happened, yet the year felt constant, sometimes even stagnant. Something has to be done about this. 

Why not take the full revolution of earth around the sun as an opportunity? I have identified 4 strands of achievements and efforts in my life at the end of 2024. Let's look at them one-by-one.

## System

2024 was a year of innovation in personal system-making. I started organizing my digital life with Johnny Decimal on 2024-01-09, and organizing my brain by journaling with tiny notebooks on 2024-01-18. Approximately **240** pages were written; **1,660** files were organized and archived according to **170** unique Johnny Decimal ID's.

In Obsidian, I wrote **543** notes with **753** links, categorized with Johnny Decimal ID's, **365** of them being daily notes. These notes contain a total of almost **100,000** words, in which are tasks, logs, and records that help me to organize and plan every day and each strand with confidence.

I sent **100** emails and received **1,900** of them. **300** new passwords were managed with KeePass. Roughly **30,000** website visits were counted. My digital heritage, or pile of trash, continues to grow.

## Language

I continued to study Latin and Japanese in 2024. At least **20** hours was spent on reading *Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata*, and at least **80** spent working on *Minna no Nihongo*. These hours represents extracurricular commitments independent of institutional instruction. 

I started using Anki for vocabulary development. **1660** items were newly added in the Japanese deck and **670** in the Latin deck. I reviewed these cards for a total of **71,870** times in **335** days, occupying **135** hours of my life. Among the hardest for me were *aestās aestātis/summer* for Latin, *急行/Rapid(Shinkansen)* for Japanese, and *kasi/plant, leaf* for Toki pona. The easiest card for me was *nōlō nōlle/to not want* in Latin, which is scheduled to repeat on 2026-08-15.

## Independent study

I read and worked on a number of books this year. Among the most memorable are:

*Calculus*, for **60** hours; *Chemical Principles*, for **45** hours; *Seminar VI: Desire*, for **45** hours; *Understanding Analysis*, for **25** hours; *The NRSV Bible*, for **25** hours; *Trans Philosophy*, for **15** hours.

A lot more time was committed to reading on minor texts. Despite the substantia level of commitment, every hour felt effective. 

## Social Practice

After the completion of my training on 2024-02-08, I have been shifting at the Hey Sam program at Samaritans for more than **80** hours, working on ethical suicide prevention. I have also continued psychoanalysis myself, completing over **30** sessions within the year.

Despite my impacts on the *MWH* series of courses starting to fade, I have spent approximately **50** hours on teaching students in-person, most of them being interdisciplinary Science-English classes.

## Summary

Approximately **700** hours were meaningfully tracked in the system, with clear starting points, progress, and goals. It's not a bad number. It's 8% of the entire year. The system has been working, and progress has been made.

My goal for 2025 is not to make this number bigger. Tracking loses meaning and effectiveness if the percentage become excess; commitment and involvement will start to fade. The focus will not be the number. Like photos, numbers represent the lived experience, and the humanity in experience will forever be my focus.
