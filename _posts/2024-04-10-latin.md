Behold! The declension chart for Latin nouns in all its glory. This was made as a typesetting practice. Turns out you needed to space everything extra carefully because of the extra bar in the middle! I think it turned out nicely, though.

As stated in the file: this is released under CC-0, and examples are picked from Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata (though LLPSI in no way "owns" these words, it still gave me tremendous help by, uhh, listing everything out for me). Typesetting by me.

mi tawa a!
