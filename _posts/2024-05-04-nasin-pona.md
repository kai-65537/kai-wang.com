As usual, a little bit of context, because this song is in toki pona: Toki Pona is a philosophical artistic constructed language created by Sonja Lang known for its small vocabulary, simplicity, and ease of acquisition.

Here’s a link to the Youtube video:

This song is designed to be a minimum viable creation of Jacob Collier style Teto-only acapella music. Of course, with the awesome Jacob Collier song as the basis, nothing could go terribly wrong. I knew that this would sound okay, and everything should be fine if I knew what I was doing.

I came up with the line “nasin pona lon telo ike” in the shower, and everything just stemmed from there. Translating the song was sort of easy, because I know where I had to make compromises. I understand that nothing is perfect, and making something that is not perfect is certainly a lot easier (and faster) than making something that is perfect.

I started by purchasing the “essentials” plan of [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/). It was a recommendation from Tris’ blog, and I quite like the look and feel of it. I liked that I instinctively knew how to use it, and that it worked without needing to configure much on Linux. Not a lot of software are able to do Linux audio right.

I started by copying down the harmony part of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ym6disE7Ue8) transcription made by the awesome Jason Fieler. Everything was easy except for the fact that I haven’t read sheet music for a long time. I made some mistakes, but I was able to correct them later. Then, I split the harmony into 9 voices, and tuned them separately using OpenUTAU. The hard part is getting a synthesizer to sound like a choir, because variation needs to be added by hand. After this, I did some mixing on the harmony part, and this part could be considered done.

The melody part was even easier, apart from having to stretch some parts of the harmony out because the mistakes I made. I didn’t like the tuning of the melody, and I think more work could be done. I didn’t know how to improve this as of right now, but I will study more and hopefully, one day, understand how to tune UTAU voicebanks properly.

So… *It’s done!* I don’t like this creation too much, but I think if I do something like this again, I will be able to complete everything faster and maybe even better. I would do the melody before the harmony, and make sure everything was correct before I go to the next stage. I would perhaps use different voicebanks for different parts too, just to make the lower parts sound better. The big mystery is solved: Jacob Collier style Teto-only acapella *is* possible. 

Who knows what will be the next step? More toki pona songs? More acapella songs? Maybe even totally original creations? I am planning more small-scale tests like this, and I am planning to get a digital keyboard maybe in the next few months, so stay tuned!
