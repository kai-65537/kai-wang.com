As usual, a little bit of context: toki Pona is a philosophical artistic constructed language created by Sonja Lang known for its small vocabulary, simplicity, and ease of acquisition.

I have made songs with UTAU or Vocaloid tunings before, but this is my first time attempting to tune toki pona. Anyway, here’s the lyric video:

When I heard this song on Pokemon Day, I knew that I had to make something based off of it. It’s cute, it’s wholesome, and iyowa just pulled another classic iyowa again. There were 3 key changes in the first verse alone, and they didn’t even try to hold back the super-iconic chromatic descensions.

## Translation

The translating process was quite a pain. First of all, my Japanese is pretty bad, especially on the grammar side. This meant that I didn’t even know what the original lyrics said super clearly to begin with, and I know how inaccurate machine translations of lyrics can be—even more inaccurate than my own translations! My toki pona was pretty bad as well at the time of translating this, and I had to refer to my one-page cheat-sheet constantly. This made the entire process extra painful, but from my perspective, I did find some pretty elegant solutions to some of the translation problems.

I knew that accuracy wasn’t my goal. I’ve seen quite a few toki pona translations of songs, and most of them completely deviate from the expressions of the original lyrics, instead opting for a more paraphrasing approach. I tried to preserve as much as possible, however, I don’t think the result is particularly pleasing. I wasn’t satisfied, but it was good enough.

## Tuning

Using UTAU, I obviously couldn’t use 初音ミク again like in the original soundtrack. I knew that I was inexperienced, so I picked a very versatile and robust voicebank—重音テト—which would hopefully survive my uneducated manipulations. Its voice range was quite wide, which proved absolutely mandatory because of how ear-piercingly high this song’s vocal goes.

Japanese aligns with toki pona’s phonemes pretty well, with a few exceptions. Two I had to constantly deal with were [wi] and [si]. In Japanese, the two supposed equivalents were [β̞i] and [ɕi]. [ɕi] is way too far from the intended [si] sound, and [β̞i] doesn’t exist in most voicebanks (not even テト!) because the corresponding kana, ゐ, is historical and isn’t used anymore.

I had to make compromises. I joined the [ɯ] and [i] back to back to make something that sounds kind of like [wi]. In fact, the IPA symbols themselves look quite similar! [si] then was achieved by synthesizing a [sɨ], cutting off most of the vowel section, and playing [i] immediately. Admittedly, some places sounded wonky, but this is really the best I could do.

As for the actual tuning, I had no vision in what I wanted, so I only did minimal amounts of pitch bending and vibrato editing. I didn’t think it was very good, but it’s definitely good enough for this project.

## Visuals

If you are in the conlang community, you will definitely recognize this style from jan Misali. It’s quite a good format, and it saves so much time. It only took me some 3 hours to write all the comments and compile everything into a video. I didn’t typeset the pi phrases correctly, but it definitely looks neat thanks to the well-designed C059 and linja pona fonts.

## So… It’s done!

I really, really wanted to get this done. I knew this wouldn’t earn any popularity, and it will only be something that I can show my friends in the toki pona community. However, it is a proof of concept, and it is super important for me that I know I know how to make something like this. If I wanted to make something good, I would probably get stuck on the translation, or the tuning, or the visuals. Every step could easily take at least 3 months.

I’m honestly really happy that I rolled this unpolished product out in the world: I’m a big believer of the “cult of done” manifesto. Although perfect is better than done, I certainly will not be able to manage “perfect”. I didn’t even know if I could manage “done”, but a 2-week-long project like this won’t eat up too much of my time anyways.

I will definitely roll out more unpolished projects like this in the future. They will be bad. All of them. However, I can learn something new from every attempt, and hopefully, eventually—eventually, they will be good. Or at least tolerable!
