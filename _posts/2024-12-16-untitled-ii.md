The following is a poem composed by me and Mông-dziao, in collaboration with ChatGPT, simulating the documentary hypothesis: I composed the main corpus, then Mông-dziao contributed more than half of the content. Finally, ChatGPT acts like a priestly (P) layer and tries to blend, then improve on the two layers, while preserving the two distinct styles. The surviving K (Kaiist) layer is marked in pink. Everything else is M or P.  

Enjoy.
